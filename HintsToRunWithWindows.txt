The most important part is to get access to make.  To do this, I installed 
chocolatey by running the following command in an elevated powershell terminal

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

After restarting the shell, I ran 'choco install make' to install make and created a new makefile using windows commands as needed

I then had to set maketools' extension settings:
makefile path: directory to the makefile (C:\XXXXX\GitHub\outel-8227\MakefileWindows)
Make path: make

I then needed iverilog (choco install iverilog)
